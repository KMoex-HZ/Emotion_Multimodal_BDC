 Is it true that super samar is actually Indonesian superhero? That's a joke of a question. That's a joke of a question. I hope he's joking. Is it? No, no. Because we're talking about the Surah Pintasabhas Mart, right? Right. We don't know where it is. But he's joking. This person is joking and saying, isn't an Indonesian superhero. But where is the letter? Where do you think the super samar letter is right now? You need to ask Asfi Adam. You know, people have done research on this. Okay, okay. With the star, it's a bit like Hitler darries. Is it real? Is it the chosen paper from that time? Is the signature real? I know that pressure was put because you, so, general you, so, and other generals went to about in Zor, went to Bokor, went to the Estonabokor, to pressure Sikano to sign something. Or my hot thick is they just lost it somewhere on the way. It's an oopsie. My hot thick is someone just drove and oops, lost a paper. But this is a very Indonesian, the idea that you have a sort of Serat wasiat.
