 I'm Lisa de Giza from Indonesia and I'm so excited to be here today with you to talk about your regarding Upcoming movie Captain America Brave New World. So I'll show you again to the questions Knock it out. So first of all the release of Captain America Brave New World is surely a long awaited moment for fans around the world including me and the teaser I watched it alone is so intense action packed and Super fun and also gives MCU a fresh new look for me It's over a very amazing, but first of all I want to ask you personally What was the most amazing thing about this movie and also is there anything new that's never been done before I was the most amazing thing is reconnecting with all friends Tim Black Nelson and John Carlo Esposito are two people I've admired through my entire career and Starting in a New York theater scene. I've known them for a very long time So I was very happy to hear Tim was coming back and you know once we got John Carlo it was I mean you can't ask for a better opportunity to work with two of your old friends Yeah, you know, so that was that was great. That was exciting because you know I've never been able to chop it up with them on the boards and now I had the the opportunity to request them and get them in my movie That's amazing So you've been obviously evolving with the character for about a decade now So from Falcon to Captain America what was the most Challenging and also what do you feel about the character development and what changed the most the biggest challenge was not being able to Have as much fun when I was Falcon Falcon was there with Captain America So all of it was new and fresh to him all of it He had never you know shot down aliens or done anything like that before his world was very small and Specific to wear to DC and work him with soldiers and being a counselor in a pastry But then once the bandit was pulled off and he got to see the difference in what was behind the curtain It changed everything he realized the intensity of the the universe around him and what his job was to not only save His community but to save the world so there was a certain gravitas and wait to that and he really changed the Perspective of the character in the universe. Okay. That's amazing Well, I really can't wait to watch the movie but let's play a game from scale one to five Let's give the movie a quick rate. So first the story one to five story is a four and a half a four and a half Okay, wait, it's five good of that. Yeah, no five is really good. So four and a half for an action Action is a six Action sequences in this movie because I got a new suit from Wakanda the stuff that I'm able to do the action Sequences the fights that I'm able to have is unlike anything you've seen Steve Rogers do is unlike anything You've seen anybody in in the MCU do because I have wings I have the ability to shoot fight kick and you know do all this stuff
