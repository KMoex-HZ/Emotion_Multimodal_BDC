Yeah, this is one of the most famous, I think, the most famous, after Sunta Empire. After Sunta Empire as the Hitler-Dali in Garot. Hitler-Dali in Garot. So what is your official take? Well, my official take is that, yes, I mean, there was a connection between Japan and Nazi Germany. And lots of Nazi officers from the Admiral Ruder's fleet came here. Surabaya was a major naval asset, and we have diaries of German officers who were secondited here. They got not a terribly warm welcome from the Japanese, but they did come here. They had this was like Portugal. It was a place where you could refit, you could disguise, you know, under say, you boats. And yeah, there were key figures within the Abwehr and within the, particularly the Navy, the Kriksmarin, which were here in visiting. Hitler did not die in Garot.
