 Saya rasa apa yang kita boleh buat adalah, you know, you have to make time to reflect what is your mindset right now because when you have the right mindset just continuing like what Dutra Nya said every season, every activity small big and full-defined small big anyway right? It's actually Baraka activity so I think that what helped me is the right mindset and I feel what I would like to share to you if you have the right mindset and then, you know, every trouble every goodness, every season every activity is actually worship to Allah
